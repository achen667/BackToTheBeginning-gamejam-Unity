Where are you going?            [press "enter" to continue]   
F
who are you?       
D
I'am the developer.so where are you going?
F
I was just.. you know.. hanging around ,seeing what's in here .
D
Oh,you'd better be just hanging around Cause you know,you are now in a game. I think you may know about it.
F
Yes I do. And .. ?
D
This game is prepared for a GameJam . And every GameJam has a theme. 
D
This time we must make sure that you always stay around the spawnpoint.
D
because our theme is End Where You Started.
F
it's not my business ok ? I don't care you aim or goal . i am gonna do what i want
D
but you are somehow under my control . there are still rules you need to obey
F
So you mean the spawnpoint I just left is also the END ? Can't I go any where ?
D
I think you're right.And I will sometimes check if you are here, so don't try to get away from here.
emmm
That's weird.Even in games ,there are never rules that you must stay where you are and do nothing.
I must do somethings ,just as a game character ,doing what i should do.
