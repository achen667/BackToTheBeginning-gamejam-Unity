where am i now ?
here is void
who am i?
i can be the developer,be the character fox and i can be you
so we won ? we made it to the destination ?
is there any difference ?
i am sure that the only same thing that we all will experience is that
	we all stop in the end  
no matter what have we achieved ,what decision have we made
we still try to do something ,even though we all end up like this
why ?
cause that is the proof that we exist
not only you ,the player, the human once existed
but also us, the game character 
we have existed on the disk, on the memory ,the process unit...
and one day ,we all disappear with this universe..
start from the void   ,   return to the void

that's the reason why we are alive
thank you for playing
