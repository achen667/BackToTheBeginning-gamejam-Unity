there's no surprise that you sure made it . you just want to escape from here ,don't you ? 
D
But I just want to tell you , there is no difference between staying and leaving.
D
Cause you know if you take one pace forward , you may step into void.
D
and you know what will happen. you will vanish , in any sense
D
your gameobject will be destroy , your instance will be destructor .
F
my fate will never change, the result is the same no matter what i choose.
F
but i have to make choice
D
so.. if you've made up your mind , then just walk forward and jump
D
or you can just jump back to where you begin ,we are all here waiting for you
D
it's easy ,right?
